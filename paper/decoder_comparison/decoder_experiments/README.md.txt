This folder contains files required to run the decoder compariosn experiments described in Appendix C.
- You get the reconstruction results by running decode_methods.R. Same as the compression experiments, remember to make the directories and subdirectories, which are formatted as decode_data/METHOD_data/DATASET/
- Once done, you can run the decoder_plot.R to get plot results
