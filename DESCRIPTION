Description: Autoencoding random forests (RFAEs) provide a method to autoencode
    data using random forests, which involves projecting the data to a latent
    feature space of chosen dimensionality (usually a lower dimension), and then 
    decoding the latent representations back into the input space. The encoding
    stage is useful for feature engineering and data visualisation tasks, akin
    to PCA's usage, and the decoding stage is useful for compression and 
    denoising tasks. At its core, RFAE is a post-processing pipeline on a 
    trained random forest model. This means that it can accept any trained RF
    of ranger object type: RF, URF or ARFs. Because of this, it inherits RFs'
    robust performance and capacity to seamlessly handle mixed-type tabular 
    data. For more details, see Vu et al. (2025) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21441>.
